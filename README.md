# ImageEditor
Team Project #1 for Mobile Development CSCI 3113

<b>Goal</b><br>
The purpose of this assignment is to work as a team to build an image transformation tool. The
application will load an image and have buttons to transform the image to Gray scale, Sepia
Tone and a 3rd image transformation of the teams choosing. There are out of the box filters and
image transformations to do this, but the team needs to create the Gray scale, Sepia and 3r
transformation bit by bit looping through the pixels in the image.
